# Frodo-Game
Similar to iconic game of all time 'Snake' - the movement of main hero is set by an interval
and player is in charge of a direction in which 'Frodo' is moving. The goal is to collect as many 
Rings as possible, trying to avoid borders (walls) at the same time.

Technologies used:
* HTML 5
* CSS 3
* JS

Enjoy!

## EDIT
As a practice, I have updated this project to ES6 - funcionality stays almost the same, however the code is cleaner.
